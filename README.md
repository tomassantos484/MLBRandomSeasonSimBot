# MLBRandomSeasonSimBot
This repository will be home to the code that I use in my MLBRandomSeasonSimBot Twitter Bot. The main goal of my TW Bot is to randmoly generate MLB players based on stats from the 2022 MLB Season. There are multiple files involved with this TW Bot, all of which I will add (except for TW API Keys). Feel free to improve the code in your own way/make your own Twitter Bot based on my own. If you do decide to improve the code on your own, I would love to hear about the changes you made to make it better.
